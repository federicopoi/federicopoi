### Hi there 👋

My name is Federico, I’m a Senior and student-athlete in the Tennis team at Southwestern College, Kansas. I major in Computer Science with an emphasis in business and my areas of interest include full-stack development and mobile development. 

I have significant experience in full-stack development through an internship at Viaanix and personal projects. My portfolio with two of my most important projects and skillset details can be found here https://www.federicopoi.work/. I’m a performance-oriented full-stack developer and student-athlete who strongly believes in turning conceptual ideas into reliable software products.

I am actively looking for internships in the roles of full-stack developer, software developer, mobile developer. 🙌 😁
